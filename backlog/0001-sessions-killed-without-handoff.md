title: Supervised sessions are killed mid-turn and never write a handoff
status: open
opened: 2026-08-04

requirement: User Story 2 - Autonomous loop mode and handoff on Windows

## Evidence

Measured 2026-08-04 from `~/.operator/trace.jsonl`:

- 940 `session_exit` events recorded. **Every one carries `restart=False`.**
  Zero handoffs have ever been written by any instance.
- `handoff` appears 0 times in the entire trace, over its whole history.
- 939 of the 940 carry no exit code at all; the single exception is
  `3221225477` (`0xC0000005`, access violation).
- `copilot-tools` alone accounts for 155 of them. The four most recent ran
  387s, 367s, 268s and 458s before dying -- 4.5 to 7.6 minutes. None was idle.
- No `next-session.md` exists for this project, and `superseded/` holds 10
  files, which is the shape of handoffs written but never read.

The restart marker is load-bearing here and was verified rather than assumed:
`handoff_tool.py:975` touches `state_dir() / instance_id`, and
`copilot_operator.py:4236` records that same marker as `"restart"` into every
`session_exit`. So a session that ended *via* a handoff would show
`restart=True`. None does.

Root cause, from the Copilot debug log of one dead session
(`~/.copilot/logs/process-1785875597356-65372.log`): all seven extension hosts
exit with `3221225786` (`0xC000013A`, `STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT`) within 22ms of
each other, and Copilot then shuts down cleanly 3ms later because its
extensions are gone. The shutdown is orderly; what precedes it is not. All
eight project instances are hit within roughly 70ms, repeatedly -- one
broadcast, not eight independent decisions.

## Why it matters

The spec this item names records User Story 2, "Autonomous loop mode and
handoff on Windows", as **Delivered**, and in practice it is not: no handoff
has ever been written. Every session's accumulated context is dropped on the
floor when it dies, which is the exact failure the backlog this item lives in
exists to mitigate.

The agent is killed mid-turn, so it never reaches the point where it would
write a handoff. No amount of agent-side discipline fixes this.

## Notes

**The emitter is still unidentified.** Three hypotheses were tested and
refuted by measurement, not by argument:

- *Shared console.* Each instance has its own console with 11 members and the
  pid sets are completely disjoint, measured via `GetConsoleProcessList` and
  `AttachConsole` from a child process. A Ctrl+C in one terminal does not
  reach the others.
- *Operator's own control plane.* No operator command in the trace coincides
  with any kill.
- *Name-based process kills by agents, and scheduled tasks.* Neither lines up.

Do not close this by asserting a cause. An explanation that fits the evidence
is not the same as the explanation, and this item has already survived three
that fitted.

## Correction, 2026-08-05: the handoff evidence above was an instrument artifact

**Everything in *Evidence* about handoffs never being written is withdrawn.**
The kills are real and unexplained; the claim that no handoff has ever been
written was measured with three instruments, and all three were incapable of
reporting the thing they were read as ruling out.

1. *"940 `session_exit` events, every one carries `restart=False`."*
   `_record_session_exit` was called from exactly one place:
   the `else` of `if marker_set(instance.restart_marker)`. It only ran once
   the restart marker had already been established absent, so `restart` could
   not carry `True` in any record, ever. Sessions that *did* end by
   handoff took the other branch and were **not recorded at all** — the
   population excluded the cases being counted, and an excluded case does not
   look like a missing row.

   The `False` was not even reliably a `False`. `marker_set` answers the same
   way for "the marker is not there" and "the probe could not look", and the
   unreadable-marker guard on that path checked only the stop and detach
   probes — so an unreadable restart probe was written down as definite
   absence. Both are fixed here: the branch now records the tri-state
   `marker_state` result, so a `False` in a record dated 2026-08-05 or later
   means the marker was observed absent, and `null` means nobody could tell.

2. *"`handoff` appears 0 times in the entire trace."* `handoff_tool.py` does
   not import `operator_trace` and never has. The trace records `operator`
   invocations; `handoff` is a separate console script, so its absence there
   is a fact about which program writes the file.

3. *"No `next-session.md` exists for this project."* True at that instant and
   consistent with the opposite conclusion: the protocol has the *reader*
   delete it at session start — a convention agents follow rather than
   something any code here enforces — so an absent handoff is the normal
   steady state between a session starting and the next one ending. This is
   the weakest of the three refutations: it establishes that the observation
   cannot distinguish the two cases, not that the handoff was there. The
   positive counter-evidence below is what settles it.

Positive counter-evidence, measured 2026-08-05T02:20Z:
`~/.copilot/projects/{guid}/next-session.md` was written at 02:16:00Z with a
full handoff, and the supervisor relaunched 33 seconds later at 02:16:33Z. The
state file advanced `SESSION_NUM` 221 → 223, and session 222 — the one that
wrote it — appears **nowhere** in `trace.jsonl`, whose last record of any kind
is 40 minutes earlier. That is the branch above, observed. `superseded/`
holding 10 files points the same way: that directory is only written by the
preserve-then-publish path, which runs when a handoff is being *written* over
an unread one.

Both instruments are fixed as of this correction: `session_exit` is now
recorded on the restart paths too, with the marker state passed in rather than
re-probed at a call site that had already decided it (see
`tests/test_loop_resilience.py::test_a_session_ended_by_a_restart_request_is_traced`).
**The trace is only trustworthy for sessions after that change**, so any
re-measurement must be scoped to records at or after 2026-08-05 — the 979
older ones cannot answer this question and never could.

There was also a mechanism actively teaching agents the wrong thing here. The
"a handoff file could not be found" note was decided **once**, before the
supervisor's loop began, and then reused for every session of the run. This
project's run started 2026-07-30 and had reached session #223, so sessions
were being told their predecessor had crashed on the strength of a probe taken
25 days and hundreds of handoffs earlier. Fixed in the same change. An agent
reading that note is a plausible origin for this item's framing, and it means
the *reports* of lost handoffs are not independent of each other.

**What still stands, unchanged:** sessions are being killed mid-turn, in
broadcast waves, by something unidentified, and the copilot debug log evidence
(`0xC000013A` across all seven extension hosts within 22ms) is untouched by
any of this. What is no longer established is that the kills cost a handoff
every time. Re-measure before assuming either way.
